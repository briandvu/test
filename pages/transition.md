Use of the extended contracts will be further restricted by the limitations process and the freeze on modifications and orders. Read more about this in the letter to all Agency Transition Sponsors [PDF - 189 KB] from FAS Assistant Commissioner Laura Stanton.

* We update the Networks Authorized User List (NAUL) April 24, 2023 [XLSX - 74 KB]  of agencies authorized to use the extended contracts (see Section H.2.3a and b of those contracts) as we enforce the eligibility condition for the extension of expiring contracts. In preparation for the Continuity of Service period, we prepared a Preliminary NAUL [XLSX - 83 KB] to indicate the agencies that will be authorized to use the Continuity of Service Period and those that will be removed from the NAUL in May 2023.
